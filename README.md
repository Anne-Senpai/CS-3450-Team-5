## Version Control:

We will be updating the version every saturday, after the code has been 
verified by all members of the team, to ensure correctness and that the 
different pieces of code works together.

the first number refers to the current milestone we are working on
The second number refers to the week that we are on for this milestone

## Build instructions:

1. pip install -r requirement.txt\
2. cd .../bbpg/\
3. python manage.py runserver  

## Unit Testing Instructions:

Unit tests will be provided as an option in the source code. simply start 
up the source code and choose the unit testing option. from there, it will
show you what parts of the project are operational, and which are still 
under construction.

## System Testing Instructions:

When testing the system, there are several cases that should be checked for;

1. purchasing a parking space for varying amounts of time
2. overriding a parking space sale
3. refunding a parking space sale
4. adding time to your purchased space
5. verifying the code for a purchased space
6. etc.

Check all of these, and more to ensure program functinality.
